In the grocery store, we cannot always quickly determine whether a food product is right for us or not, how safe and healthy it is. The situation becomes more complicated if a person has dietary restrictions, various allergies, or is on a diet. Foodwise Android app lets you scan a product barcode and effortlessly see if it should be consumed.

The app has three main sections: Profile, Camera and History.

In the "Profile" your preferences are set: in the "Ingredients" section you can exclude any of the 60,000 ingredients included in the database and read information about E-supplements. "Groups" allow you to exclude a whole block of ingredients at once. For example, if you select "Vegetarian", then all products containing meat will be highlighted in red.
